    <!-- The WallpaperManager uses the aspect ratio of the drawable
         area (screen height - system bar height - navigation bar
         height) to calculate the scaling factor needed for the
         wallpaper parallex effect. With the standard settings the
         wallpaper is scaled to a width of 2098px which is too wide
         to be used as a texture map with the SGX540. Reducing the
         height of the navigation bar decreases the aspect ratio and
         the scaled wallpaper ends up with a width of 2047px which
         the SGX450 can handle. -->
